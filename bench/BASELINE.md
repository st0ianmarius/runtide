# Benchmark baseline

`npm run bench` (tinybench, `bench/run.ts`), never part of `npm test`. Each task runs a batch of 1,000 operations per call, since one operation is far below the timer's resolution; the numbers are the mean time per operation.

Recorded at F1 on the development container (Node 22.22.2, linux x64, shared and noisy), as the range of three runs. They are a first reference, not a budget: CI on a fixed machine type sets the budgets later (§I.5.4).

| benchmark                                        | ns per op |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --------- |
| registry `get(id)` + typed column read           | 21–29     |
| registry `has` bit + hook dispatch table call    | 11–14     |
| bitset `has`                                     | 9–14      |
| bitset `intersects` (an immunity check)          | 20–30     |
| timing wheel schedule + collect (15% overflow)   | 54–80     |
| keyed roll, 5-part key passed as arguments       | 34–66     |
| keyed roll, 4-part key in a reused scratch array | 30–43     |
| sequential stream draw                           | 11–12     |
